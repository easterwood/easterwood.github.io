Nested and mixed lists are an interesting beast. It's a corner case to make sure that

* Lists within lists do not break the ordered list numbering order
* Your list styles go deep enough.

### Ordered -- Unordered -- Ordered

1. ordered item
2. ordered item 
  * **unordered**
  * **unordered** 
    1. ordered item
    2. ordered item
3. ordered item
4. ordered item
